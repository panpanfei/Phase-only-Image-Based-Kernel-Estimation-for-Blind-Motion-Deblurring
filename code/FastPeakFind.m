function  [cent, varargout]=FastPeakFind(d, thres, filt ,edg, res, fid)
% Analyze noisy 2D images and find peaks using local maxima (1 pixel
% resolution) or weighted centroids (sub-pixel resolution).
% The code is designed to be as fast as possible, so I kept it pretty basic.
% The code assumes that the peaks are relatively sparse, test whether there
% is too much pile up and set threshold or user defined filter accordingly.
%
% How the code works:
% In theory, each peak is a smooth point spread function (SPF), like a
% Gaussian of some size, etc. In reality, there is always noise, such as
%"salt and pepper" noise, which typically has a 1 pixel variation.
% Because the peak's PSF is assumed to be larger than 1 pixel, the "true"
% local maximum of that PSF can be obtained if we can get rid of these
% single pixel noise variations. There comes medfilt2, which is a 2D median
% filter that gets rid of "salt and pepper" noise. Next we "smooth" the
% image using conv2, so that with high probability there will be only one
% pixel in each peak that will correspond to the "true" PSF local maximum.
% The weighted centroid approach uses the same image processing, with the
% difference that it just calculated the weighted centroid of each
% connected object that was obtained following the image processing.  While
% this gives sub-pixel resolution, it can miss peaks that are very close to
% each other, and runs slightly slower. Read more about how to treat these
% cases in the relevant code commentes.
%
% Inputs:
% d     The 2D data raw image - assumes a Double\Single-precision
%       floating-point, uint8 or unit16 array. Please note that the code
%       casts the raw image to uint16 if needed.  If the image dynamic range
%       is between 0 and 1, I multiplied to fit uint16. This might not be
%       optimal for generic use, so modify according to your needs.
% thres A number between 0 and max(raw_image(:)) to remove  background
% filt  A filter matrix used to smooth the image. The filter size
%       should correspond the characteristic size of the peaks
% edg   A number>1 for skipping the first few and the last few 'edge' pixels
% res   A handle that switches between two peak finding methods:
%       1 - the local maxima method (default).
%       2 - the weighted centroid sub-pixel resolution method.
%       Note that the latter method takes ~20% more time on average.
% fid   In case the user would like to save the peak positions to a file,
%       the code assumes a "fid = fopen([filename], 'w+');" line in the
%       script that uses this function.
%
%Optional Outputs:
% cent        a 1xN vector of coordinates of peaks (x1,y1,x2,y2,...
% [cent cm]   in addition to cent, cm is a binary matrix  of size(d)
%             with 1's for peak positions. (not supported in the
%             the weighted centroid sub-pixel resolution method)
%
%Example:
%
%   p=FastPeakFind(image);
%   imagesc(image); hold on
%   plot(p(1:2:end),p(2:2:end),'r+')
