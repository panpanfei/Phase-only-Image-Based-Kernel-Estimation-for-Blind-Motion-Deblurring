Please cite our paper if using the code to generate data (e.g., images, tables of processing times, etc.) 
in an academic publication.

Notes 
----------------
For algorithmic details, please refer to our paper.
We give the result of our method in file 'result'. Include dataset from 'Levin', 'Kohler', 'Gong' and 'Pan'.
For better result, some parameters are carefully designed. 
We also use some strategies like the 'patch-wise process' and 'coarse to fine', etc. 
The current release version is mainly for tackle uniform motion blur, especially on linear motion. 
The non-uniform deblurring can be achieved by segment the input blur image to overlapped square patches.

How to use
----------------
The code is tested in MATLAB 2015b(64bit) under the ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64bit version with an Intel Core i7-4790 CPU and a6 GB RAM.

1. unpack the package
2. include code/Phase_for_public/ in your Matlab path
3. Run "main_uniform.m" to try the examples included in this package.
----------------
User specified parameter:
----------------
There are a few parameters need to be specified by users.
---------------
Kernel estimation part:
---------------
'motionb'    :   1 for synthetic testing data
'kernel_size':   the size of blur kernel  (traditional method usually needs to change this parameter manually)
'auto_size'  :   the scale for autocorrelation
'lambda_grad':   the weight for the L0 regularization on the gradient (typically set as 4e-3)
---------------

----------------
IMPORTANT NOTE 
----------------
1. Note that the algorithm sometimes may converge to an incorrect result. When you obtain such an incorrect result, please re-try to deblur with slightly changed parameters (e.g., using large blur kernel sizes or autocorrelation size). 
2. Our method works better in linear uniform motion. 
3.Should you have any questions regarding this code and the corresponding results, please contact Liyuan.Pan@anu.edu.au
